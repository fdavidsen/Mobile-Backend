The collaboration was formed when Queen’s active members Brian May and Roger Taylor appeared on American Idol in 2009, where Lambert was a contestant.\nAfter their initial meeting, the trio performed together for the first time at the MTV Europe Awards in November 2011, receiving a positive response from fans and critics alike. The following year, Queen + Adam Lambert embarked on their first tour, performing across Europe and the UK. Since then, the collaboration has continued to tour the world, bringing Queen’s iconic catalog of hits to audiences around the globe while also paying tribute to the late Freddie Mercury.\nIn 2019, Queen + Adam Lambert first announced the Rhapsody Tour. The concert tour was met with critical acclaim, with many praising Lambert’s ability to channel Mercury’s charisma and stage presence while still making the songs his own.",
